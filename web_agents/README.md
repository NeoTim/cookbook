# Web Agents

Code corresponding to the [Web Agents cookbook](https://swim.dev/tutorials/web-agents/).

## Running This Demo

This demo only requires running the `swim.basic.BasicPlane` class.

Thus, `gradle web-agents:run` is sufficient for those who pick Option 2 in [`README.md` from the parent directory](../README.md).

For those who pick Option 3, simply execute `gradle web-agents:build`, unpackage either artifact in `web-agents/build/distributions`, and run the appropriate script in `bin/`; no file copying/editing is required.
